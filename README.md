# Garment-mini-lab-project
This is a Mini Project for Garment Management System.

Creating an object model for a Ready-Made Garments (RMG) system in Java involves defining the classes, their attributes, and the relationships between them. Below is a detailed specification for this object model, which includes the necessary classes, attributes, methods, and their relationships. Object Model Specification for Ready Made Garments are.

**4. Order**


Attributes:

String orderId - Unique identifier for the order.

Date orderDate - Date when the order was placed.

List garments - List of garments included in the order.

double totalAmount - Total amount for the order.


Methods:

void addGarment(Garment garment) - Adds a garment to the order.

double calculateTotalAmount() - Calculates the total amount of the order.

Methods:

void placeOrder(Order order) - Places an order.

List viewOrders() - View orders made by the customer.


**6. Inventory**


Attributes:

List garments - List of garments in inventory.


Methods:

void addGarment(Garment garment) - Adds a new garment to inventory.

void removeGarment(String id) - Removes a garment from inventory by ID.

Garment findGarment(String id) - Finds a garment by ID.

# Relationships Among Classes

Garment uses Fabric: Each garment is made of a fabric, so an attribute in the Garment class could refer to the Fabric class.

Order contains multiple Garments: The Order class will hold a collection of garments that are being ordered.

Supplier provides Fabric: A supplier provides various fabrics, so thereâ€™s a one-to-many relationship (one supplier can supply many fabrics).

Customer can place multiple Orders: A customer can place multiple orders, establishing a one-to-many relationship between Customer and Order.
